This dataset is downloaded from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing). It contains data of 41,188 and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010) 


The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. This is to analyze the effectiveness of the campaign through phone calls and access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 

## What is a term deposit?
A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution. Term deposit investments usually range from one month to a few years and will have varying levels of required minimum deposits.
The investor must understand when buying a term deposit, they can only withdraw their funds after the term ends. In some cases, the bank may allow the investor for early termination or withdrawal, however there will be a penalty assessed for early termination.
